Python Number Recognition
=========================

Updated version of [this repo](https://github.com/ilovepjs/WhatsMyNumber).

Number recognition using neural networks.

To get up and running:

    git clone https://github.com/ilovepjs/NumberRecognition.git
    cd dir
    pip install requirements
    cd src
    python numrec.py

Still a work in progress but should be up and ready shortly with a demo too. ;)
